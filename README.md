## Introduction

Back in 2001 I wrote a Java Application that was able to calculate all solutions to a Standard Yasumi Puzzle. In those days (on a Pentium III) it took about 20 minutes to calculate
all possible solutions.

After many years I decided to get the program back out and test it on my current hardware Macbook Pro i7 and found the program is now taking under 3 minutes (without any changes).

I then took the program and created some Fuse Services around it and ported that to the FIS environment running on OpenShift ... Let us see if we can beat the 3 minutes by scaling out ...
